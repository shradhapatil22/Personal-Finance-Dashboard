# Personal Finance Dashboard

The Personal Finance Dashboard is a data analytics project designed to create a personalized finance dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard enables individuals to track their expenses, income, and financial goals in a user-friendly and visually appealing way.

## Features

1. **Expense, Savings, and Income Breakdown**: The dashboard provides a detailed breakdown of expenses, savings, and income. Users can select a specific month and year to view the breakdown for that period. It allows users to analyze their spending habits, understand their savings patterns, and track their income sources.

2. **Tiles for Monthly and Yearly Overview**: The dashboard includes interactive tiles that display essential financial metrics such as expense percentage, savings percentage, income, and net worth. These tiles dynamically change based on the selected month and year, providing users with an overview of their financial situation at a glance.

3. **Bar Graphs for Expense and Savings Components**: The dashboard features bar graphs that visually represent the components on which the income is spent and how savings are allocated. Users can analyze their spending and savings patterns, identify major expense and savings categories, and track variations over time. The graphs also include tooltips that show the variation of expense and savings components over the selected months and years.
